# Prompt Regression Testing

> **"pytest for multi-agent prompts"** — catch prompt regressions before they reach production.

## The problem

When you change a system prompt in a running pipeline, there's no safety net. A prompt tweak that looks harmless can cascade through multiple agents, silently degrading output quality in ways that only surface days later in production.

Traditional unit tests don't help because the outputs are non-deterministic. What you need is **mutation testing against recorded runs**.

## How it works

AntCrew's `replay_with_mutation()` in TraceLog re-executes a historically recorded run with a modified prompt for one agent and quantifies the diff:

1. **Record** — run your pipeline with `--full-trace` to capture every prompt + response
2. **Mutate** — substitute the system prompt for one agent
3. **Replay** — re-run every agent call in order, with the new prompt for the target agent
4. **Diff** — compare the new output against the original using unified diff; compute `diff_pct`
5. **Gate** — exit code 1 if `diff_pct > threshold`

## CLI usage

### Prerequisites

Record a run with full trace enabled:

```bash
antcrew run "Build JWT auth" --team dev --full-trace --trace-db ~/.antcrew/trace.db
```

Get the run ID:

```bash
antcrew trace ~/.antcrew/trace.db
# Shows run list — copy the ID
```

### File-based prompt test

```bash
antcrew test ~/.antcrew/trace.db \
  --run <run-id> \
  --agent BA \
  --prompt v2_ba_prompt.txt
```

### Inline prompt test

```bash
antcrew test ~/.antcrew/trace.db \
  --run <run-id> \
  --agent BA \
  --prompt-text "You are a Business Analyst. Be extremely concise."
```

### Output

```
antcrew test  run=4c3fa8b2…  agent=BA  threshold=20%

 Agent          Mutated  Diff %  Match  Cost
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 BA             ✎        34.1%   ✗      $0.0041
 PM             —        —       ✓      $0.0028
 BackendDev     —        —       ✓      $0.0056

✗ FAIL  diff=34.1%  threshold=20%  changed=1/3 agents
```

Exit code `0` on pass, `1` on fail.

### JSON output for scripting

```bash
antcrew test trace.db --run $RUN_ID --agent BA --prompt v2.txt --json
```

```json
{
  "run_id": "4c3fa8b2...",
  "agent_name": "BA",
  "threshold": 0.2,
  "diff_pct": 0.341,
  "passed": false,
  "total_changed": 1,
  "calls": [...]
}
```

## CI/CD integration

### GitHub Actions

Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Prompt regression test
  env:
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  run: |
    antcrew test trace.db \
      --run ${{ vars.BASELINE_RUN_ID }} \
      --agent BA \
      --prompt prompts/ba_v2.txt \
      --threshold 0.15
```

### Recommended workflow

1. Record a **baseline run** after each major prompt release and store the run ID in CI variables
2. On every PR that touches a prompt file, run `antcrew test` against the baseline
3. Set threshold per agent based on how sensitive it is (BA: 15%, code generators: 25%)
4. Block merge if any agent exceeds its threshold

## Threshold guidelines

| Agent type | Recommended threshold |
|---|---|
| Business Analyst / PM | 10–15% — precise specs, low tolerance |
| Reviewer / QA | 15–20% — structured feedback, moderate |
| Code generators | 20–30% — stylistic variation acceptable |
| Content agents | 25–35% — creative flexibility expected |
